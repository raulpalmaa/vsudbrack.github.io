**Hi, I'm Vítor Sudbrack**, 

a student of Master in Physics program at the *Institute of Theoretical Physics (IFT - Unesp)* in São Paulo - SP, Brazil, working from Palma de Mallorca[^2], Spain, to get a *sandwich degree*.

My carrier ~~overdrinking coffee~~ in Physics started in 2014, but back then I was just learning calculus. In 2019, I was laureated Bachelor in Physics with honors by the *Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)* in Porto Alegre - RS.

My regular work is done at IFT under the supervision of professors Roberto A. Kraenkel and Renato M. Coutinho. Together, we study numerically population dynamics in highly fragmented landscapes. We aim to understand the effects of fragmentation and habitat spatial features into species and ecological systems. You can read much more about [here](/projects/frag.html). 

During pandemic times, we joined an [Observatory](https://covid19br.github.io) - a collection of scientists from very complementary backgrounds aiming to understand the data from COVID-19 in Brazil. You can imagine what a hard task that is.	

I already researched at Fluid Lab (IMPA) with professor Alexei Mailybaev in Rio de Janeiro, RS. We studied fully developed bidimensional turbulence in the case of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. And I worked as well at the Laboratory for Cellular Structure (*LabCel - UFRGS*) during my undergraduate years. There I started working with mathematical biology, **uncracking the puzzles of life** [^1]!

I am mostly **interested** in *mathematical biology*, i.e., modelling population dynamics, complex systems and evolution. Also, I enjoy some mathematical ~~monsters~~ puzzles such as non-linear differential equations and graph theory. I love giving seminars and talking to people about my researches and other interesting things, invitations are always welcome!

I like to believe **I create universes on a computer screen...**, but 95% percent of the job is looking at data on this same computer screen *hahah*
