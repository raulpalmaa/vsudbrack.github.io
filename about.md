# Hello,

**I'm Vítor Sudbrack**, Brazilian scientist, pursuing a Physics Master program at the *Institute of Theoretical Physics (IFT - Unesp)* in São Paulo - SP, Brazil; and currently working at the *Institute for Cross-Disciplinary Physics and Complex Systems (IFISC - UiB)* Palma de Mallorca, Spain, to get a *sandwich degree*.

My career ~~overdrinking coffee~~ in Physics started in 2014, but back then I was just learning calculus. In 2019, I was laureated Bachelor in Physics with honors by the *Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)* in Porto Alegre - RS.

My regular work is done at IFT under the supervision of professors Roberto A. Kraenkel and Renato M. Coutinho. Together, we numerically study population dynamics in highly fragmented landscapes. We aim to understand the effects of fragmentation and habitat spatial features into species and ecological systems. You can read much more about it [here](/projects/frag.html). 

During pandemic times, we joined an [Observatory](https://covid19br.github.io) - a collection of scientists from very complementary backgrounds - aiming to **understand and analyze the data from COVID-19 in Brazil**. You can imagine what a hard task that is...	

I already researched at the *[Fluid Lab - IMPA](http://fluid.impa.br/Home)* with professor Alexei Mailybaev in Rio de Janeiro, RJ. We studied fully developed bidimensional turbulence in the case of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. And I worked as well at the Laboratory for Cellular Structure (*LabCel - UFRGS*) during my undergraduate years. There I started working with mathematical biology, **uncracking the puzzles of life**!

I am mostly **interested** in *mathematical biology*, i.e., modeling population dynamics, complex systems and evolution. Also, I enjoy some mathematical ~~monsters~~ puzzles such as nonlinear differential equations and graph theory. I love giving seminars and telling people about my research and other interesting things. Hence, invitations are always welcome!

I like to think **I create universes on a computer screen...**, but 95% percent of the job is looking at data on this same computer screen *hahah*

Studying and researching allowed me knowing **many people, many places and many wonders** of this universe. I share for science the same feeling *Lise Meitner* described to physics in this quote below.

It is a kind of personal love, as one has for a person to whom one is grateful for many things." %}
