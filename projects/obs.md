title: 'Observat처rio Covid-19 BR'
---

I was one out of 40+ transdisciplinary members of the **Observat처rio COVID-19 BR** (Observatory COVID-19 BR), a project meant to make real-time analysis of COVID-19 data and micro-data to inform population and guide authorities in Brazil. We established partnerships with the Secretaries of Health of S찾o Paulo State, 9 northeast Brazilian states (*Cons처rcio Nordeste*) and a few municipalities. 

We applied statistical techniques, such as *nowcasting*, to data; we simulated scenarios with mathematical modellings; we calculated epidemic indices, such as Effective Reproductive number ($$R_{eff}$$); we projected number of cases, deaths and hospital beds needed in the short-term, among many other analysis. We realised few technical notes about state's reestablishment plannings and took part in several interviews and media agenda. 

This project is fully volunteering and there is no financial interest.
