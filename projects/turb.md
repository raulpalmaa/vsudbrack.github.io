title: 'Bidimensional Turbulance'

## Turbulence in fluid dynamics

Fluid dynamics (the study of liquid and gases behaviour) has some open problems for centuries. The reason for that is its **non-linear equations of motion**, which need state-of-the-art mathematical and computational tools to solve and understand the particular behaviours of self-organizing structures in bidimensional turbulent flows.

Through spectral methods, we study in this project the instability and turbulence in incompressible 2D fluids solving numerically Navier-Stokes equation in the vanishing viscosity limit and, then, comparing the results with data from point-vortex methods, which simulates an ideal fluid (zero viscosity).


## Kelvin-Helmholtz instability

In the case of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, we find many similarities in the behaviour of both fluids, although we found differences in the energy spectra of an ideal and viscous fluid. We can see there exists **energy and enstrophy transfers between multiple scales** of structures.
