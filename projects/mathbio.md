Here, I wrote about a few of these lensings I've already worked on... 

## Graph Theory Applied to Biology

**Networks** (or graphs) are mathematical tools we use to model real problems (in biology, sociology, geography, economy,...) and study them systematically. In particular, it is possible to study *expanding networks*, given a node addition rule. We studied numerically the growth of some of these networks based on averages of random initializations and analytically, through a **master equation formulation** applied to these addition rules, accounting for all possible scenarios that may probabilistically happen within the model. 

The importance of this work is predicting the future behaviour of the real systems described by the studied networks and understanding and quantifying the parameters related to this modeling. Here, we consider **Divergence and Duplication** networks, which mimic properties of *Protein-Protein Interaction Networks (PPI)* - i.e., given **mutation parameters**, the characteristic features of these graphs are similar to those found on experimental networks of related proteins. 

The results of this project were published on this article below. You can also check slides with a synthesis of the main results: determining parameter ranges for which networks reach a steady state and evaluating the time-dependent and asympthotic network degree distribution.

This work is a collaboration with professors **[Leonardo G. Brunnet](http://pcleon.if.ufrgs.br/)**, Rita M. C. de Almeida, Ricardo M. Ferreira and Daniel Gamermann within LabCel group at the Physics Institute at UFRGS. It was funded by federal government (CNPq).
