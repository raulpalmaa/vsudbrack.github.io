    <div class="project-load"><p>I joined a group of over 50 trans-disciplinary researches in the <strong>Observatório COVID-19 BR</strong> (Observatory COVID-19 BR), a project meant to make real-time studies of COVID-19 data and micro-data, to inform population and guide authorities with scientific analysis in Brazil. We established partnerships with the Secretaries of Health of São Paulo State, 9 northeast Brazilian states (<em>Consórcio Nordeste</em>) and a few municipalities.</p>

<p>We <strong>applied statistical techniques</strong>, such as <em>nowcasting</em>, to data; we simulated scenarios with mathematical modelings; we <strong>calculated epidemic indices</strong>, such as Effective Reproductive number (\(R_{eff}\)); we <strong>projected the number of hospital beds needed, cases and deaths in the short-term</strong>, among many other analysis. We <strong>released few technical notes</strong> about state’s reestablishment plannings and took part in several interviews and media agenda. Our homepage peaked 120.000 monthly viewers, with an average of 29.400 weekly viewers.</p>

<p>This project is fully volunteering and there is no financial interest.</p>

<h4 id="how-can-mathematical-concepts-help-us-to-understand-this-pandemic-crisis">How can mathematical concepts help us to understand this pandemic crisis?</h4>

<p>In this interview on G1 by Laís Modelli and Lara Pinheiro, <strong><a href="https://g1.globo.com/bemestar/coronavirus/noticia/2020/03/31/crescimento-exponencial-e-curva-epidemica-entenda-os-principais-conceitos-matematicos-que-explicam-a-pandemia-de-coronavirus.ghtml">Exponential growth and epidemic curve: understand the main mathematical concepts that explain the coronavirus pandemic</a></strong> (in portuguese), we give some of the main epidemiological concepts to understand a epidemic curve, such as the epidemic cycle that is formed by three stages: exponential growth, saturation and exponential delay.</p>

<p>Besides the exponential growth in the number of case of the COVID-19, there is, however, a more <strong>complex underlying dynamics</strong>, because not only the local transmission of the virus happens throght the <strong>dynamics of spread</strong> by contagion (from one person to other people), but also by a <strong>dynamical spread of focuses</strong> - intercommunications between countries/states resulting new focuses of communitary transmission.</p>

<h4 id="why-should-we-current-notification-delay">Why should we current notification delay?</h4>

<p>Daily notified cases come from the results of confirming laboratory exams, such as RT-PCR. But the results confirmed today belong to patients who got infected a few days ago - this is the so-called <strong>notification delay</strong>. It is the time interval between infection and notification, and it includes many bureaucratic and epidemiological stages, such as the incubation period of SARS-Cov-2, the time for having symptoms, going to a health care unit and collecting the sample, the time to analyze that sample and, finally, the time to type the result into the database of cases - which in Brazil is the SIVEP and eSUS-VE.</p>

<p>This <strong>statistical technique</strong> is called <em>nowcasting</em> and it’s based on Bayesian statistics. It allows a more <strong>realistic and accurate real-time epidemic curve</strong> of cases and deaths. I talk more about it in this interview with Karina Toleto to Agência FAPESP, <strong><a href="https://agencia.fapesp.br/ferramenta-permite-monitorar-em-tempo-real-o-avanco-da-covid-19-na-cidade-de-sao-paulo/32987/">Tool allows monitoring realtime progress of COVID-19 in São Paulo city</a></strong> (in portuguese): <em>“If I have a friend who is always 10 minutes late for an appointment, I know I can arrive 10 minutes after the scheduled time. Thus, there is a greater chance that we will arrive together. I adapted my response based on average behavior. The logic of the tool is more or less the same”.</em></p>
